Basics,Select all columns from the table identified by 'syn123'.,select * from syn123
Basics,Select only two columns identified by 'foo' and 'bar' from the table identified by 'syn'123'.,"select foo, bar from syn123"
Basics,"To refer to a column name that contains spaces or punctuation, the name must be with double quotes.","select ""has space"" from syn123"
Basics,Any double quotes within a column name must be escaped with another double quote.,"select ""The """"Cool"""" name"" from syn123"
Aggregation Functions,Count the number of rows in table 'syn123'.,select count(*) from syn123
Aggregation Functions,Get the maximum of all values for the column 'foo' in table 'syn123'.,select max( foo ) from syn123
Aggregation Functions,Get the minimum of all values for the column 'foo' in table 'syn123'.,select min(foo) from syn123
Aggregation Functions,Get the average of all values for the column 'foo' in table 'syn123'.,select avg(foo) from syn123
Aggregation Functions,Get the sum of all values for the column 'foo' in table 'syn123'.,select sum(foo) from syn123
Set Selection,The DISTINCT keyword can be used to select all distinct value (the value set) from a column. ,select distinct foo from syn123
Set Selection,"The DISTINCT keyword applies to all selected columns, so if more than one column is listed, then the results will be a list of the distinct combinations of all selected columns.","select distinct foo, bar from syn123"
Set Selection,"The DISTINCT keyword can be used with set functions.  In this example, we will get the count of the distinct values from the foo column.",select count(distinct foo) from syn123
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value equal to one.,select * from syn123 where foo =1
Filtering,"Select all rows where column foo has a string value equal to 'a string', the right-hand-side but be within single quotes (').",select * from syn123 where foo = 'a string'
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value greater than one.,select * from syn123 where foo > 1
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo have a value greater than -1.98e12,select * from syn123 where foo > 1.98e12
Filtering ,Select all rows where column foo has a value  less than one.,select * from syn123 where foo < 1
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value that does not equal one.,select * from syn123 where foo <> 1
Filtering ,Select all rows where column foo has a value greater than or equal to one,select * from syn123 where foo >= 1
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value less than or equal to one.,select * from syn123 where foo <= 1
Filtering,"Select all rows where column foo has a value equal to one, two, or three.","select * from syn123 where foo in (1,2,3)"
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value between one and two.,select * from syn123 where foo between 1 and 2
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a null value.,select * from syn123 where foo is null
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value that is not null.,select * from syn123 where foo is not null
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value with a prefix of 'bar'.  In this example the right-hand-side of the LIKE keyword is a regular expression where the '%' represents one or more characters or even zero characters.,select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar%'
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value with a prefix of 'bar'.  In this example the right-hand-side of the LIKE keyword is a regular expression where the '_' represents one and only one character.,select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar_'
Filtering,The default escape character for LIKE regular expression is the '\' character.  In this example we want to find all rows such that foo that contain 'bar_' so we will need to escape the '_' character.,select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar\_'
Filtering,"To use a different escape character for LIKE regular expression we must define the escape character.  In this example, the '|' will be used as an escape character instead of '\'.",select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar|_' escape '|'
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value equal to one or column bar has a value equals to two.,select * from syn123 where foo = 1 or bar = 2
Filtering,Select all rows where column foo has a value equal to one and column bar has a value equal to two.,select * from syn123 where foo=1 and bar =2
Filtering,Predicates can be surrounded by the '(' and ')' to enforce precedence and nesting.,select * from syn123 where (foo=1 and bar =2) or foobar = 3
Grouping,"Select all rows grouping first by foo, then by bar.","select * from syn123 group by foo, bar"
Grouping,"Grouping can be used in conjunction with aggregation function.  In this example, values from the foo column are first grouped, then the average of each group is calculated. For this example, one row will be returned for each group.","select foo, avg(foo) from syn123 group by foo"
